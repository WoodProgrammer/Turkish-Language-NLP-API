The lexica for the three languages have
been taken from public sources. For English
it has been obtained from the website
www.audiencedialogue.org/susteng.html; for Hindi
and Bengali, the word lists as well as the unigram
frequencies have been estimated from the monolingual
corpora published by Central Institute of
Indian Languages. We chose to work with the most
frequent 10000 words, as the medium size of the
two Indian language corpora (around 3M words
each) does not provide sufficient data for estimation
of the unigram frequencies of a large number
of words (say 50000). Therefore, all the results
described in this work pertain to the SpellNets
corresponding to the most frequent 10000 words.
However, we believe that the trends observed do not
reverse as we increase the size of the networks.
In this paper, we focus on the networks at three
different thresholds, that is for θ = 1, 3, 5, and study
the properties of Gθ for the three languages. We
do not go for higher thresholds as the networks become
completely connected at θ = 5. Table 1 reports
the values of different topological metrics of
the SpellNets for the three languages at three thresholds.
In the following two sections, we describe in
detail some of the topological properties of SpellNet,
their implications to spell-checking, and observations
in the three languages.
